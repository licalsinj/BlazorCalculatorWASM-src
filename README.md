## Purpose
A simple calculator built in Blazor with C# so that I can practice with Blazor. 

### Functions
Currently the calculator does Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. 
It has the ability to inverse a number and type decimal point numbers.
It can chain functions together, meaning you can calc 2 numbers then a third without having to hit equals inbetween.

## Known Issues
If you have a result with a decimal like 1 / 3 the calculator will let you type in a new decimal point and instend of appending a number to the end it will add the number to your result.

## Future Enhancemments
I would like to add a scientific calculator and a graphing calculator.
I would like to add a history of calculations with the ability to go back to a previous calculation.
